# Innovative-Smart-Railway-Platform-for-Domestic-Railway-Station
This innovation is to address few problems faced by physically challenged people and senior nationals in crossing of foot over bridge between the two railway Platforms. The smart Platform is participated amidst the railway tracks in the side of the crossing point Platform. At the moment that there is no train arriving in the station, the smart Platform will be opened. To overcome this issue, a modified smart platform is proposed using machine learning algorithm (CNN- Convolution Neural Network and Haar-Cascade classifier).
